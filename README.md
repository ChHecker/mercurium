# Mercurium
Named after the messenger of the gods Mercurius, this is my attempt at a simple package manager.  
**This is not intended to be used! I just created this for fun!**

## Features
- Support for custom packages using `TOML`
- Automatic building from source
- Dependency resolving
- SHA512 checksum checking

## To-do
- Build dependencies
- Uninstall (keep track of installed files, maybe using `fakeroot`?)
- Better "UX"
- Multithreading

## Licenses
For all licenses, look into `license.html`.
